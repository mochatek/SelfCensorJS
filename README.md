__SelfCensorJS__ is a JavaScript library that provides a simple solution for censoring segments of video in the browser. 
It enables us to define different censor tracks based on age ratings or genres or any other category, and then automatically 
skip the specified intervals in the video according to the selected track.

With SelfCensorJS, you can easily add censoring functionality to your video player without the need for any additional plugin 
or server-side processing. The censoring is performed entirely in the browser, while providing a smooth and uninterrupted viewing 
experience for the user.

## Use Cases

- __Parental Controls__: SelfCensorJS can be used to enable parental controls for video content, allowing parents to restrict their children's 
access to certain categories of content based on age rating, genre, or other criteria.

- __Online Streaming Platform__: SelfCensorJS can be used by online streaming platforms to provide a more customizable and personalized viewing 
experience for their users. By providing different censor tracks for a movie, like with subtitles, users get the option to watch different censor
versions of the same movie, based on their preference. They can even add their own custom-censored version.
